# Aves_Ascend
Aves Ascend is a unique flight simulation game where planes navigate and fight through fractal environments. 
The game is developed mostly from scratch using Julia.
The game features environments with varying gravity and air density.
The physics engine uses Projective Geometric Algebra.

Note that this project is very early in development.
